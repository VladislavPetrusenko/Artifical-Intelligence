# K-means Clustering.py for data-analysis

Why K-means? machine learning or data mining methods may help us to learn and
analyze big data sets. Clustering methods for example can help you to find out whether the
classification suggested for your data set has anything to do with your data. If the clusters that the
automated clustering generated is significantly different from a classification you thought of, this
indicates that factors played a role when determining a classification that are not (fully) supported by
the data but may be based on some information.
